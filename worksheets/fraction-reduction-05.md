**Tip for practice:**
- Find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator
- Divide both numbers by the GCF to reduce the fraction
- You can find the GCF by listing factors of both numbers
- A fraction is fully reduced when the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1
- Remember: if both numbers are even, you can always divide by 2
- Example: 12/18 → GCF is 6 → 12÷6 = 2, 18÷6 = 3 → 12/18 = 2/3
